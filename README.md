- 👋 Hi, I’m @DonutsNCodce
- 👀 I’m interested in Robots, AI and leading the sales force that brings it home.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI - I coded a gold trading platform via chatgpt and github with no experience in coding or trading.  Unbelievable.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the next company to bridge the gap and bring robots and ai into the home for consumers at scale.  I have years of startup experience and want to put it to good use.
- 📫 How to reach me scott.kirkpatrick.8808@gmail.com or 858.583.0455
- 😄 Pronouns: male
- ⚡ Fun fact: I failed miserably at moving to brick and mortar launching a gourmet donut business.  we expanded to 3 tourist trap locations and hit 5M in revenue but I burned through my savings and investor capital.  Lesson learned.  It's great to be delusional, but you gotta run it by numbers and focus on the right people you surrounded yourself with, no matter what.  I failed, so you don't have too!  :D
